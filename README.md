# Redmi Fuel Band users - Workout Analysis for the month of January
An analysis of workouts by users of the Redmi Fuel band fitness tracker.

# About the analysis

For the sake of this analysis, I assume a case study where the product manager has asked to know how effective, users workouts have been in the month of January, and has therefore posed some questions to be answered through my analysis. The following are questions the Product manager is interested in to get insights from the data:

1. What workouts were practiced frequently in the month of January?

2. Saturdays are usually a day of dedicated workouts by users, so what workout types are popular amongst users on Saturdays.

3. What was the maximum calorie burned for each physical activity across all users?

4. What was the maximum distance ever travelled by a user throughout the month for each workout type?

5. What is the most effective workout?
